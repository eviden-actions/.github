# Atos Actions

We are building GitHub Actions for the Atos organization and the open source community.

## 🔍 Using Our Actions

### For Everyone

Browse our public actions on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?query=eviden-actions) to find reusable workflows and actions published by Atos Actions.

### For Atos Developers

Internal actions are available within the [**Atos** GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprises/atos-international). These actions are set to **Internal** visibility and can be used across Atos organizations.

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to **Atos Actions**! Please check out the [Contributing guide](https://github.com/eviden-actions/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines about how to proceed.

Make sure to follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/eviden-actions/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 🆕 Create New Actions and Workflows

Have an idea for a new action or workflow? Follow these steps:

### 1. 💡 Share Your Idea

Before creating anything, **share your idea as a discussion** in our [Ideas category](https://github.com/orgs/eviden-actions/discussions/categories/ideas). This allows the community to:
- Provide feedback and suggestions
- Identify similar existing actions
- Help refine your concept
- Avoid duplicate efforts

### 2. 🏗️ Choose Repository Type

Based on your action's intended audience:

#### **Internal Actions (Atos Only)**

For actions intended for internal Atos use only:
- Create the repository with **Internal** visibility
- This makes the action available to all Atos organizations
- No additional approval needed from maintainers
- Follow the [custom actions docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions)

#### **Public Actions (Community)**

For actions that could benefit the broader community:
- **First, check with the [Maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/eviden-actions/teams/maintainers)** before creating a public repository
- Ensure your action doesn't contain any Atos intellectual property
- Determine the appropriate open source license
- Consider [publishing to the GitHub Marketplace](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace) for wider visibility

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always discuss your idea first and get maintainer approval before creating public repositories.
