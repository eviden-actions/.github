<h1>Actions</h1>
</div>

We are building Github Actions for the Atos organization and the OpenSource community.

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to **Atos Actions**! Please check out the [Contributing guide](https://github.com/eviden-actions/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines about how to proceed.

Make sure to follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/eviden-actions/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## 🆕 Create new actions and workflows

You have an idea for a new action or workflow that you'd like to develop?!
First of all, the same action/workflow or a pretty similar one doesn't already exist.
If you're unsure, check with the [Maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/eviden-actions/teams/maintainers)

To proceed with your idea create a new repository and follow the [custom actions docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions).

> [!NOTE]
> Setting the repository visibility to **Internal** is one of the requirements to make the actions available to other **Atos** Organizations

### 🧺 Public actions and GitHub Marketplace

Some actions might be useful to our customers, outside of the scope of the [**Atos** GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprises/atos-international)...

In order to do so, you will have to determine:

- That your action doesn't contain any **Atos** intelectual property and its code can be made public
- Which license model the code should be published under
- Whether or not you would like to promote your action by [publishing it to the GitHub Marketplace](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace)

Once clarified, contact the [Maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/eviden-actions/teams/maintainers) to start the validation process
